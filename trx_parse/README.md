# Virtuoso Transaction Log Parsing based rsine complement 

## Overview

This project aims to set up a testing environment to compare subscription and notifications services. 

The Subscription and Notification Services (SNS) considered are those that allow to the user to subscribe for notifications on specific changes to triples in an RDF Store. 

We are interested in performance test considering the following metrics:

* **Query response time**: Depending on the implementation of the Service may impact the performance of the RDF Store. Thus, a list of arbitrary queries are prepared to be able to test Store query response time.
* **Notification response time**: We want to know how quick the Service will notify the user of a given subscription.
